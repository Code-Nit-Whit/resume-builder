# Resume Builder

## Project Description

Resume Builder is an innovative application designed to revolutionize the way individuals create professional resumes. Developed with Rust for its efficiency and reliability, and utilizing the Tauri framework for cross-platform support, this project aims to provide a streamlined, user-friendly interface for crafting personalized resumes. Initially envisioned as a personal portfolio project, it has evolved into a broader vision of empowering job seekers with a tool that adapts to their needs, ensuring their applications stand out across various industries.

## Current Phase

As an early-stage project, Resume Builder is currently focused on establishing a solid foundation. The primary goal is to develop a functional prototype that demonstrates the core functionalities of the application. This phase involves:

- Defining the data structures and models required for handling resume content.
- Implementing the basic UI components necessary for user interaction.
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility through Tauri.

## Future Directions

While the initial focus is on functionality and usability, future iterations of Resume Builder will introduce more advanced features aimed at enhancing the user experience and expanding the application's capabilities. These enhancements include:

- A dynamic template system allowing users to choose from a variety of professionally designed templates.
- Advanced customization options enabling users to tailor their resumes to specific job applications.
- Cross-platform accessibility, ensuring users can access and edit their resumes on any device.

## Open Source Contribution

Although contributions are not yet being accepted, the intention is to eventually open-source Resume Builder. This decision reflects a commitment to transparency, community engagement, and continuous improvement. Once the project reaches a stable state, contributors will be welcomed to join in developing new features, fixing bugs, and improving the overall quality of the application.
